# Microblogging Network

## Concept

This application is a social network oriented to microblogging. Everyone can make posts and comment posts of other users. A comment works exactly like the parent post does, so we can have infinitely nested posts.

## Purpose

The purpose for this application was for me to become better at the use of graphql, and managing all this data with this nested posts included with this query language. Also, I wanted to learn how the third-party authentication services work, so I added initially a GitHub OAuth service and I hope adding more services like this one in the future.

## Use guide

To use the application you can enter the url linked to this repository or:

1. git clone https://github.com/Frandols/microblogging-network
2. cd microblogging-network
3. npm install
4. npm install concurrently --g
5. Set your enviroment variables for the application
6. npm run dev

Enjoy it!
